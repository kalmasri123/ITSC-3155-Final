### Kevin Chen

 - Worldbank.org: https://data.worldbank.org/country/russian-federation?view=chart Russian Federation, look at the economic status of Russia, from before their war with Ukraine.
 - Historians, economists, governments, general public with savings in banks. 
 - Rather than solve a problem it would inform the gernal public the power of the bank and how pissing off the wrong people can cause you to lose your savings, it will also show the cost of war. 
 - FOR the general public WHO wish to be informed about economics and the costs of war, THE BEWARE OF BANKS is a data analyzer THAT shows how powerful banks are, how they can manipulate your money without your consent, and what the cost of war is economically, through real data from Russia, UNLIKE other analyzer, OUR product actually exists. The product is useful due to the warning it presents and 100% not something I just made up on the spot.
 - In-depth look at Russian GDP before and during war, look at spending costs of Russia, showing trends through comparing with other graphs during wars, controversial inclusion of Canada when protestors had bank accounts frozen.
